<h2>Background</h2>
<p> The entire site is a web app written in python. Currently it is using python 2.7
(I would rather have it in python 3 but there is some problems with the utf-8 encoding, if you can fix it
everything should be compatible with newer versions of python).</p>
<p>The entire site source code (minus datasets) is available at this github repository:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/LuisSoares/H3K4_webapp">github.com/LuisSoares/H3K4_webapp</a></p>
<p>To run the site locally just you can just clone the repository and launch web_site.py.
The code is not really commented but with minimal python knowledge you will be able to
costumize the site to your datasets and preferences. If you want to deploy the web site
    yourself make sure to change the default JavaScript in each app since it currently
    links to my google analytics.There is also a helper script called
Data_load.py that creates the hd5 files with the datasets that are used in web site.
I was able to successfully deploy the website in both heroku and pythonanywhere for global
access, if you need instructions contact me.</p>

<h2>Dependencies</h2>
<p>The website is built with the spyre frame work that is built on top of cherrypy.
There are several dependencies that must be installed (they are all available with pip)
    to run the script. The dependencies
can be infered by the imports of each .py file but the list is:</p>
<dl>
    <dt>spyre:</dt>
    <dd> build the framework</dd>
    <dt>cherrypy:</dt>
    <dd>To serve the the website (I think it is installed with spyre)</dd>
    <dt>h5py:</dt>
    <dd>To create and access the datasets</dd>
    <dt>numpy:</dt>
    <dd>To deal with the datasets data</dd>
    <dt>matplotlib:</dt>
    <dd>To draw the plots in the Gene plotter</dd>
    <dt>intermine:</dt>
    <dd>To link the gene names to gene codes using SGD data</dd>
    <dt>pandas:</dt>
    <dd>To draw the tables in the Gene plotter</dd>
    <dt>bokeh:</dt>
    <dd>To draw the plots in Comparisons</dd>
</dl>
